/*
 * This webhook is called whenever a new user tries to sign up on the site using the Netlify Identity Wisget.
 * It checks that the user's email is on a permitted domain (such as username@ntti3.io),
 * and will only allow new users to sign up from permitted domains. Upon a valid signup, the new user is
 * automatically given the 'reader' role, so that they may view everything on the website.
 *
 * To get this script called by Netlify, you need to activate the webhook, here are the steps:
 *     - go to the Netlify Site Settings for your web site
 *     - look for the Settings -> Identity -> Notifications section
 *     - edit the Webhook
 *     - set the URL to https://<your-site-name>.netlify.com/.netlify/functions/webhook
 *     - leave the Secret field blank
 *     - check the event box for validate
 *     - click on the Save button
 *
 * In addition, the site should have a _redirects file that limits access to those with particular roles.
 * This will restrict visitor access to only those people with a role that permits access.
 *
 * Here's what the _redirects file should look like for your static website when you publish it on Netlify:
 *
 *     /test/* 200! Role=reader
 *     /test/ /login 404
 *
 * (replace test with the name of your protected sub-folder, and login with the name of the fail html file)
 *
